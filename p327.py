Rooms 6, cards 4
We need to get to room 3 with 4 cards.
We need to get to room 3 with 3 cards, and have one there.
We need to get to room 2 with 3 cards, and have one there.
We need to get to room 1 with 3 cards, and have one there.

Una carta en room 3, tengo que llevar 3 a room 2 (+1 de room 2) = 4 en room 2
Para llevar 4 a room 2, lo puedo hacer a partir de 8 desde room 1. (+1 de room 1) = 9 en room 1
Para llevar 9 a room 1, lo puedo hacer con 18 desde el origen.
NO. Para llevar 9, necesito llevar 8 + 1. Para llevar 8, necesito 16, para llevar 1, necesito 3.
16 + 3 = 19.

19 + 4 llaves que me cojo al principio = 23.
