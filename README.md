# About

According to their own site, [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that
will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although
mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the
use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most
problems.

I have been tackling these problems at random intervals since 2011, while
I was still studying my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Mathematics.

Note that there might be problems for which I have no code, since in the
beginning I solved them in Java but unfortunately I lost the code.

Furthermore, since many problems might benefit from specific functions
(such as efficient prime sieve generation or probabilistic primality
tests), I have compiled the ones I consider relevant enough in
[functions.py](https://github.com/Flood1993/ProjectEuler/blob/master/functions.py).
